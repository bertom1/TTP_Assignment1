## Collaboration Workshop
This repository is for the second of many assignments for the Tech Talent Pipeline Residency bootcamp at Brooklyn College. The primary focus was to familiarize ourselves with git
in a collaborative setting, allowing us to practice skills such as branching, merging, and opening issues or pull requests when working in a remote setting.  
The website created is meant to be a fundraising site for a specific cause, in this case we chose to do a covid relief fun. Our site contains three seperate pages - 
* A landing/home page with some information about the cause (index.html)
* A donation page meant to collect funds (donation.html). Includes input fields for donation amount and payment information
* A contact page where visitors can reach out for more information if interested, or to contact the charity if needed (contact.html). Includes input fields for name, contact 
information, and an additional message.
