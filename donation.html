        <h2>Donate Today</h2>
        <p>This fund depends on donations from people like you. Every donation we recieve goes directly to those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, whether it be for food, medicine,
            bills, or assistance with remote learning. Without this fund, and the donations we recieve, many New York City Residents would be left on their own during these difficult
            and unprecedented times. We accept all donation sizes, so feel free to donate what you can. As a registered 501(c)(3) public charity, all donations are tax-deductible. To
            recieve a donation reciept, or to donate material goods such as food and medicine, reach out to us via our contact page.
